        You’re on the north shore of a river, and want to cross to the south, via a series of 13 bridges and six islands, which you can see in the diagram below. But, as you approach the water, night falls, a bad storm rolls in, and you’re forced to wait until
        morning to try to cross. Overnight, the storm could render some of the bridges unusable — it has a 50 percent chance of knocking out each of the bridges. (The chance is independent for each bridge.)

      <p class='copy'>When tackling a problem like <a href="https://twitter.com/ollie">Ollie Roeder's</a> latest Riddler, I like to start by breaking it down into a simpler problem. If the question is about a river with 6 islands arranged in 2 rows / 3 columns, what
        is the answer for no islands? For 1 row / 2 columns of islands? Take a look at at these diagrams below and click to simulate 10,000 results of the scenario:</p>
      <div class='threeCharts'>
        <div class='inset zeroRow'>
          <img src='bridges.png'>
        </div>
        <div class='inset oneRow'>
          <img src='bridges.png'>
        </div>
        <div class='inset twoRow'>
          <img src='bridges.png'>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class='copy'>Certainly seems like regardless of how many rows / columns we've got, the answer trends towards a 50% chance you'll be able to cross the river in the morning. How can we confirm that?</p>
      <p class='copy'>Let's take the slightly easier case of a river with just two islands in it:</p>
      <div class='singleChart'>
        <div class='inset oneRow'>
          <img src='bridges.png'>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class='copy'>There are five bridges. That means that when the storm rolls through with a 50% chance of knocking out each bridge,there are 2<sup>5</sup> (32) possible combinations of bridges that survive the night.</p>
      <p class='copy'>It's also easy to see there are only five unique paths that can take you to the south shore:</p>
      <div class='singleChart'>
        <div class='inset oneRow simulatePaths'>
          <img src='bridges.png'>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class='copy'>If we label the paths a, b, c, d, and e as in the above image, it's easy enough to list out every peossible combination of surviving bridges vs. every available path to see the chance of success is 50%:</p>
